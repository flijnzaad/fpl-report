\section{\appendixname: Python script for sudoku generation}
\label{app:sudoku}

The following code is an adaptation of code to be found \href{https://www.101computing.net/sudoku-generator-algorithm/}{here}; we deleted its GUI-related code, improved its formatting, and added some lines at the end so the output of the program was in a usable format for us and is written to a file.

The code generates a finished sudoku, removes some numbers from it and then ensures that the resulting unfinished sudoku has exactly 1 solution.
